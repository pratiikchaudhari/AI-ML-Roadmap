## 📘 Module 1: Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra forms the mathematical backbone of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This module focuses on the core concepts required to understand data representation, model behavior, and optimization techniques used in modern ML algorithms.

### 🔹 Topics Covered

* **Vector Spaces & Subspaces**
  Understand the structure, properties, and significance of vector spaces. These concepts are fundamental for feature representation and high-dimensional data modeling.

* **Orthogonality & Orthonormality**
  Learn how orthogonal vectors simplify computations and improve numerical stability. These ideas are central to algorithms such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.

* **Determinants**
  Explore determinants to understand matrix invertibility, linear transformations, and volume scaling.

* **Change of Basis**
  Study how data can be represented in different coordinate systems — a key concept in dimensionality reduction and linear transformations.

* **Projection & Least Squares**
  Learn how to project data onto subspaces and solve overdetermined systems, forming the mathematical foundation of **linear regression**.

* **QR Decomposition**
  Understand QR factorization and its role in solving linear systems efficiently and improving numerical stability in ML algorithms.
