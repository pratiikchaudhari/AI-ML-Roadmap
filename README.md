##Module 1

* Linear Algebra

1. **Vector Spaces and Subspaces**: Understanding the structure and properties of vector spaces, which is fundamental for feature representation.

2. **Orthogonality and Orthonormality**: Concepts that are crucial for algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and for ensuring numerical stability.

3. **Determinants**: Useful for understanding matrix invertibility and volume scaling in transformations.

4. **Change of Basis**: Transforming coordinates from one basis to another, which is important in various ML algorithms.

5. **Projection and Least Squares**: Techniques for projecting data onto subspaces, which are key for regression and dimensionality reduction.

6. **QR Decomposition**: Another matrix factorization method that’s useful for solving linear systems and in some ML algorithms.
